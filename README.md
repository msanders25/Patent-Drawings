# Patent-Drawings

## Drawing Overview

The purpose of this repository is to showcase various patent drawings I have completed while working as a Patent Illustrator. I have been working in this field since 2017 creating drawings for various inventions and products across several industries such as manufacturing, electrical, architectural, and healthcare. I use CAD programs such as AutoCAD, Inventor, and OnShape to make the drawings.
